I'll summarize our plan for the Tronbyt + Home Assistant integration, so you have it for reference when you start the new session:

1. **Project Structure**
   ```
   tronbyt_apps/
   └── power_display/
       ├── power_display.star    # Main Starlark app
       ├── manifest.yaml         # App configuration
       └── README.md            # Documentation
   ```

2. **App Features**
   - Connect to Home Assistant API
   - Fetch `power.current_power` value
   - Display real-time power consumption
   - Update every few seconds
   - Show units (W/kW)
   - Visual representation of power usage

3. **Technical Components**
   - Starlark code for the display
   - Home Assistant API integration
   - Configuration for:
     - Home Assistant URL
     - API token
     - Entity ID (`power.current_power`)
     - Update frequency

4. **Implementation Steps**
   1. Create the basic Starlark app structure
   2. Add Home Assistant API integration
   3. Create the display layout
   4. Add error handling
   5. Test with your Home Assistant instance

5. **Required Information**
   - Home Assistant URL
   - Long-lived access token
   - Entity ID: `power.current_power`

When you start the new session, we'll begin by creating these files and implementing the functionality. I'll be able to help you with the implementation, but you'll need to provide the Home Assistant connection details when we get to that point.

Would you like me to add anything else to this plan before you close the current session?
